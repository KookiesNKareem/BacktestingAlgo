# Backtesting Algorithm for Financial Data

## Overview

This project is a financial backtesting tool designed to evaluate trading strategies on historical stock market data. It supports dynamic moving average strategies, performance analysis, and data handling. The tool can:
- Fetch historical stock data using Alpha Vantage API.
- Simulate trades based on user-defined moving averages.
- Generate insightful performance metrics such as Net Return, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

## Features

### 1. Data Fetching
- Automatically downloads historical market data in CSV format using the Alpha Vantage API.
- Ensures the data is up-to-date by checking file modification timestamps.

### 2. Trading Strategy Simulation
- Supports Moving Average Crossover Strategy:
- Short-Term Moving Average (SMA).
- Long-Term Moving Average (LMA).
- Simulates trades based on buy/sell signals generated by SMA-LMA crossovers.

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Net Return: Measures the percentage return on initial capital.
- Annualized Return: Adjusts the return for the time period of the backtest.
- Sharpe Ratio: Evaluates risk-adjusted performance.
- Maximum Drawdown: Captures the worst portfolio decline during the test.

## How It Works
### 1.	User Input:
- Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- Initial capital.
- Moving average lengths for SMA and LMA.
### 2.	Process:
- Fetches or reuses historical stock data.
- Simulates trades using the selected moving average crossover strategy.
- Calculates performance metrics.
### 3.	Output:
- Displays a performance report with:
- Initial and final capital.
- Net return (%).
- Annualized return (%).
- Sharpe ratio.
- Maximum drawdown (%).
